# Software Development-2024-2025

This repository contains coursework and projects for my Software Development class in the academic year 2024-2025.

## Python Lessons and Videos
The website for the Python lessons with videos can be found at [https://project.hosted.hr.nl/rac/it/python/](https://project.hosted.hr.nl/rac/it/python/)

## Structure of the Python Lessons
The topics of the lessons are presented in short video clips. A voice-over explains what is happening, and for certain topics, animations visually represent more abstract concepts.

## Future Updates?
Probably not, as I have completed all 8 lessons. I will only update for minor improvements if needed.

## Contributions
Feel free to open issues or submit pull requests if you have suggestions or improvements. (I'm still learning from my past mistakes)

## Declaration of Independent Work
I hereby declare that all coding assignments submitted by me have been completed independently, without assistance from others. I have not copied or used any code from external sources without proper citation. I have made this effort to accelerate my learning process in Python and to adhere to the academic integrity guidelines.
